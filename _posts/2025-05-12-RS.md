I presented my research at Rising Stars workshop last month in Austin! 

I was able to network with researchers from the United States, as well as with academics and researchers from the lab ecosystem. I learnt important skills in terms of proposal writing and grant applications, as well as communication skills for different types of audiences. The different panels allowed me to gain a good overview of the skills to build to develop myself as a successful researcher.
