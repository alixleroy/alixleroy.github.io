I am an applied mathematician, a passionate scientist and a feminist.

I am currently doing my PhD in Applied and Computational Mathematics on numerical methods for Stochastic Differential Equations. I am supervised by [Jonas Latz](https://latzplacian.org/), [Des Higham](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~dhigham/) and [Ben Leimkuhler](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~bleimkuh/). I receive the support of the Maxwell Institute Graduate School in Mathematical Modelling, Analysis and Computation CDT ([MAC-MIGS](https://www.mac-migs.ac.uk)) and the Luxembourg National Research Fund ([FNR](https://www.fnr.lu/)). 

I work on reversible Langevin dynamics to obtain sampling methods that are more computationally efficient, see [my first paper](/al-folio/publications/). One application, currently explored, is using Langevin dynamics for image classification using semi-supervised learning on graph. Stay tuned for news on the next project!

I have two BSc from the Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), in physics engineering in 2017 and business management in 2015. I also received an MSc in Environment and development in 2018 from the London School of Economics(LSE). I worked as a researcher in DRC (Democratic Republic of the Congo) in development economics and in London for the What Works for Children Social Care, managing and evaluating RCTs (Randomised Controlled Trials). I finally enrolled in an MSc in Applied Computational Mathematics at the UoE which led me to my current PhD.

Life is a journey, you might as well enjoy it, learn as much as you can and have a positive impact along the way!  :sparkles:

Representation matters, please get in touch if you would like to get a neurospicy and feminist take on doing a PhD in applied math! :seedling: :rainbow:


<!-- Semi-supervised learning methods on graph can be used for images classification in safety-critical application, such as medical imaging. In this setting, the images are represented by a set of nodes in a high-dimensional space, pairwiseconnected by edges, with weights depending on their similarity. Unlabelled images are then injected to the graph, and we aim at correctly classifying the images using graphical learning through the design of an operator such as the Laplace or Poisson operator. -->
